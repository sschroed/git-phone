# GitPhone: An experimental iPhone app to stay connected with GitHub on the go.

## Project Information

I started this project to test out some ideas for an iPhone app which utilizes a 3rd party API.  Naturally, I chose GitHub because I'm an extreme fanboy.
It's not polished.  There are no tests.  It really doesn't do anything useful and I really don't where I want to take it.  However, there is a good deal
of infrastructure here that I feel is worth sharing, especially, since there are so few OSS iPhone apps out there in their entirety.

## Moviing Forward

After posting this project many people have asked if I'm going to release this to the app store.  GP is not ready in it's current state but I would like to
get it ready.  However, I need help with coding and direction.  What do you think GP should do?  Some have suggested being able to comment on commits or edit
wiki pages.  Maybe some hard core forking action too.

I have setup git-phone in Pivotal Tracker [here](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/10185).  I will add stories people submit and will accept most any commmits
form others.  Just go ahead and start.

## Required frame-works

This project uses the [json-framwork](http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/) for easy json parsing.
Installation directions are [here](http://iphone.zcentric.com/2008/08/05/install-jsonframewor/).
